            Defauls to 600 seconds (10 minutes). An upper bound in seconds after which the job will end. This is a mitigation to the potential infinite
            monitoring loop if something weird on CircleCI's end happens. Though unlikely to happen - this catch all
            will ensure unnecessary credits aren't consumed.
